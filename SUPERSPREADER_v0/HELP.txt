Java cannot import classes from other directories unless those directories are packagdes or you add them to PATH.
That would be extremely annoying so NO. Instead reorganised the files yet again.
The master is now split between working directories (Networking / Game_Code / the other one) and THE GAME (SUPERSPREADER).
When finished code software to work in *this* folder.

Classes will be packaged into the Classes folder.
Objects will contain pictures / media.
Compile and Run exe.java from SUPERSPREADER to play the game.

Apologies.
